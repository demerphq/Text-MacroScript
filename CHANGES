Updated the ordered array code to be more efficient (as per errata for
the Wolf book).

1999/09/19

Macros and scripts are now stored in an ordered array. The tradeoffs of this
are: slightly slower define for new macros and scripts; faster expansion (up
to 40%). (The implementation of variables has not been changed.) Since one
would expect most scenarios to involve relatively few (10's, 100's) of
definitions, but lots of expansion, (100's, 1000's or 10,000's lines) this
should improve overall performance. For greater insertion speed we'd need to
use either a balanced binary tree or a B*tree.

paragraphs or entire files with identical results.
